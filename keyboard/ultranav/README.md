#Ultranav

This project supports the IBM UltraNav keyboard and my personal
preference to use only the TrackPoint on this keyboard.

## Features

* Ignore the touchpad so that it doesn't cause pointer to jump while
  using TrackPoint
* Enables third button to be used for scrolling (my OTC adapter did not
  pass it through)

## Tested With

* IBM SK-8840 (89P8500)

## Limitations

Currently only handles the mouse.
